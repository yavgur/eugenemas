                                The most fundamental teaching of Islam is to believe in the Oneness of God, 
                                in the sense of His being the only Creator, Preserver, Nourisher, etc. 
                                But this belief is not enough. Many of the idolaters knew and believed that only the Supreme God could do all this and yet they associated other gods with Him. 
                                Therefore, one must acknowledge the fact that it is God alone who deserves to be worshipped, and thus abstain from worshipping any other thing or being. 
                                Likewise, Muslims believe that God has no father or mother, no son or daughter. 
                                None is equal to Him. He is God of all humankind, not of a special tribe or race.

                                    Prayer is the name for the obligatory prayers that are performed five times a day, and are a direct link between the worshipper and God. 
                                    There is no hierarchical authority in Islam and there are no priests. 
                                    Prayers are led by a learned person who knows the Quran and is generally chosen by the congregation.
                                    Although it is preferable to worship together in a mosque, a Muslim may pray almost anywhere, such as in fields, offices, factories and universities

                                <p>
                                    An important principle of Islam is that everything belongs to God, 
                                    and that wealth is therefore held by human beings in trust. 
                                    The word zakah means both “purification” and “growth.” Our possessions are purified by setting aside a proportion for those in need and for the society in general. 
                                    Like the pruning of plants, this cutting back balances and encourages new growth.
                                    Each Muslim calculates his or her own obligatory charity individually. 
                                    This involves the annual payment of 2.5% of one’s capital, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools.
                                    An individual may also give as much as he or she pleases as voluntary charity, and does so preferably in secret. Such charity is not limited to financial giving.

                                <p>
                                    Every year in the month of Ramada-n, all Muslims fast from dawn until sundown–abstaining from food, drink, and sexual relations with their spouses.
                                    Those who are sick, elderly, or on a journey, and women who are menstruating, pregnant or nursing, are permitted to break the fast and make up an equal number of days later in the year if they are healthy and able. 
                                    Children begin to fast (and to observe prayers) from puberty, although many start earlier.
                                    Although fasting is beneficial to health, it is mainly a method of self-purification and self-restraint. 
                                    By cutting oneself from worldly comforts, even for a short time, a fasting person focuses on his or her purpose in life by constantly being aware of the presence of God. 
                                    God states in the Quran: “O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed to those before you that you may learn self-restraint.” (Quran 2:183)

                                    The pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) is an obligation only for those who are physically and financially able to do so. 
                                    Nevertheless, over two million people go to Makkah each year from every corner of the globe providing a unique opportunity for those of different nations to meet one another.
                                    The annual Hajj begins in the twelfth month of the Islamic lunar year. 
                                    Pilgrims wear special clothes: simple garments that strip away distinctions of class and culture, so that all stand equal before God.
